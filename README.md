![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a4af80-34ad-4ee7-90dc-f12d4a94d170)

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices using historical housing data. The dataset includes various features about properties, such as the number of rooms, location details, building characteristics, and other factors influencing housing prices.

## Project Structure

- `FUTUREINTERN_DS_01_House_Price_Prediction_Model.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing code for training, evaluating, and generating predictions.
- `HP_train.csv`: The training dataset with historical house prices and features.
- `HP_test.csv`: The test dataset used to generate final house price predictions.
- `house_price_predictions.csv`: The output file containing predicted house prices for each property in the test dataset.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/House_Price_Prediction_Model.git
    cd House_Price_Prediction_Model
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and generate predictions. After completion, `house_price_predictions.csv` will be created with the predicted prices.

## Data Processing and Model Training

The model uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices. Key steps include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values are handled, categorical data is encoded, and numerical features are imputed.
- **Model Training**: The Random Forest model is trained on the processed dataset.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Output File: `house_price_predictions.csv`

This file contains two columns:
- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property in the test dataset.
- **SalePrice**: The model’s predicted sale price for each property.

The predictions can be used to understand the approximate market value of each property based on the features included in the test dataset.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Lower MAE indicates better model performance. In this project, MAE helps us understand how close the model's predictions are to actual sale prices on average.

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: This metric gives additional weight to larger errors, which can be useful if outliers are important in assessing model accuracy. In this project, RMSE provides insight into how well the model performs in scenarios with significant deviations from the mean.

Both MAE and RMSE help in evaluating model performance, with RMSE being particularly sensitive to larger errors, making it useful for assessing the overall robustness of the model.

## Future Improvements

1. Experiment with different regression algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM for potentially improved accuracy.
2. Tune hyperparameters using grid search or randomized search.
3. Explore feature engineering to create more relevant features from existing data.

# Explanation of `house_price_predictions.csv`

The `house_price_predictions.csv` file is the final output of the model. It contains:

1.  **Id**: Unique identifiers corresponding to each property in the test dataset.
2. **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price generated by the model.

This file can be used to assess house prices based on model predictions, helpful for real estate insights or market trend analysis.

# Explanation of MAE and RMSE
The two error metrics serve to evaluate the model's prediction accuracy:

- # Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Purpose: Calculates the average magnitude of errors in predictions without considering their direction (i.e., whether they’re over or under).
    - Role in Process: Helps gauge the model’s average predictive error, allowing us to see how close, on average, the model’s predictions are to actual prices.

- # Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    - Purpose: Calculates the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values, giving more weight to larger errors.
    - Role in Process: RMSE is useful when large errors are a concern. It highlights cases where predictions deviate significantly from actual values, allowing us to understand the robustness of the model in handling outliers.

**Together, MAE and RMSE provide a balanced view of the model's performance, with RMSE providing insight into significant outliers and MAE giving an overall sense of prediction accuracy.**
